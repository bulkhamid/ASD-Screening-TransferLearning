# ASD-Screening-TransferLearning

This repository contains the code for our deep learning-based autism screening project using transfer learning on video data. Our approach integrates spatial, temporal, and gaze features for early ASD detection.

- **data/**: Raw and processed data (videos, frames).
- **src/**: Source code including model architectures and training scripts.
    - **models/**: Deep learning model definitions.
    - **utils/**: Helper functions (data loaders, preprocessing, etc.).
    - **train.py**: Main training script.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for experiments and prototyping.
- **docs/**: Documentation, including the literature review.
- **experiments/**: Experiment logs and results.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.

## Branches
